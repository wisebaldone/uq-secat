    <h3>What?</h3>
    <p>
      This website is an information dump for the collection of Student Evaluations of Course and Teachers at the
      University of Queensland. The course information is made public to students <a
            href="http://itali.uq.edu.au/content/student-evaluation-of-course-and-teaching-secat-results">here</a> while
      teacher evaluations are kept private to the university. This website is not affiliated with the University of Queensland.
    </p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
      The viewer for the results that the university hosts is pretty janky and takes forever to get to the course you'd
      like to view. This website was made as a portfolio piece to show an alternate way of accessing the information.
    </p>
    <h3>Who?</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Evan Hughes, I'm a Engineer &amp; Science undergrad at UQ studying Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering and
      Computer Science. See <a href="https://www.wisebaldone.com">www.wisebaldone.com</a> for more of my work or more
      about me.
    </p>
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>
      The project gathers no data of its own and collects it all from the
      <a href="http://itali.uq.edu.au/content/student-evaluation-of-course-and-teaching-secat-results">
        offical UQ page
      </a>
      where it is skimmed using a python script found <a
            href="https://github.com/wisebaldone/uq-secat/tree/master/scraper">here</a>. The scraper itself uses
      selenium due to the target website having an internal state machine for display information. This made it
      difficult to use some http posts to get the information. Instead the skimmer manually browses every page for
      every course. A json file is output for each semester the course has results and a pseudo static
      api is formed which is explained more on the api portion of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally a Angular ( v2 ) website is built around the api to display the information using plot.ly for the graphs
      and angular material for the UI design.
